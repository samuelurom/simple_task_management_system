# Simple Task Management System

This is a simple but robust task management system with a beautiful CLI that stores and retrieves data in text files.

The program has user access levels for the admin and other system users. Only the admin is authorized to:

- Register a new user
- Add a new task and assign to a valid user
- Edit all tasks _(only uncompleted tasks can be edited)_
- Generate reports and statistics

Other users can easily:

- View all tasks
- View tasks assigned to them
- Mark tasks assigned to them as completed

Please feel free to clone this repository, and run the task_manager.py file.
